# XOR Encryption Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a custom encryption and decryption scheme using XOR operations. The scheme includes a double-layer encryption process that utilizes two symmetric keys for added security. The project is divided into three main components:
1. **Encryption** (`encrypt.py`)
2. **Decryption** (`decrypt.py`)
3. **Key Generation** (`generate_keys.py`)

## Components

### 1. `xor_cipher.py`

Contains the `XORCipher` class with methods for:
- **XOR Operation**: Encrypting and decrypting data using a specified key.
- **Key Repeating**: Ensuring the key length matches the data length.
- **Double Encryption/Decryption**: Applying two layers of XOR encryption/decryption.

### 2. `encrypt.py`

Script for encrypting plaintext using two symmetric keys:
- Reads keys from `key1.txt` and `key2.txt`.
- Encrypts user-provided plaintext.
- Saves the ciphertext to `ciphertext.txt`.

### 3. `decrypt.py`

Script for decrypting ciphertext using the same two symmetric keys:
- Reads ciphertext from `ciphertext.txt`.
- Decrypts the ciphertext to recover the original plaintext.
- Prints the decrypted text.

### 4. `generate_keys.py`

Script for generating truly random keys:
- Prompts the user for key length.
- Generates and saves two random keys to `key1.txt` and `key2.txt`.

### 5. `cleanup_keys.py`

Script for automatically deleting the key files (`key1.txt` and `key2.txt`) after use.

## Usage

1. **Generate Keys**:

   python generate_keys.py

Enter the desired length for the keys. This will create key1.txt and key2.txt with random keys.

2. Encrypt Data:

python encrypt.py

Enter the plaintext when prompted.

The script will read the keys from key1.txt and key2.txt, encrypt the plaintext, and save the result to ciphertext.txt.



3. Decrypt Data:

python decrypt.py

The script will read the ciphertext from ciphertext.txt, decrypt it using the keys, and print the decrypted text.



4. Clean Up Keys:

python cleanup_keys.py

Deletes key1.txt and key2.txt to ensure keys are not left on disk.




Notes

Ensure key1.txt and key2.txt are created before running the encryption or decryption scripts.

For security, keys should be kept private and secure.

Modify the key length as needed, but ensure the keys are appropriately managed.
